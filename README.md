## My process

I started by approaching the project with a mobile first workflow. Gradually styling each breakpoint until I was satisfied.
I used SASS to style my HTML an


### Built with

### What I learned

I learned alot during this project. I learned that I need to do a better job of keeping my CSS clean and that I should refactor more often and not at the end of a project like I had here. This was my first project with 3 breakpoints and it was definitely a hurdle for me to overcome but in that process, I also learned alot of about absolute position and the need to keep my `z-index` organized. 


### Continued development

In the future I will make a large effort to keep my code cleaner, as if a psychopathic programmer is the next to maintain it, who will hunt me down if its not clean.
